    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Basic yet most authentic pizza sauce recipe out there.</p>
    <p>The key in this recipe are good quality canned tomatoes, preferably San Marzano.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>400 g can whole tomatoes</li>
        <li>4 g salt</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>few leaves basil</li>
        <li>pinch dried oregano</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Transfer tomatoes from can to mesh strainer and mash them up by hand. Don't use any blender as the would blend seeds which can give the final product a bitter taste.</li>
        <li>Transfer smashed tomatoes to a clean bowl. You can use some left over juice to thin out the sauce if it is too thick.</li>
        <li>Add salt and mix.</li>
        <li>Add a tablespoon of olive oil, some basil leaves and a pinch of dried oregano. Mix again. The sauce is finished!</li>
        <li>If you are a garlic maniac you can add one clove as well, yet the sauce will not taste so fresh!</li>
    </ol>
